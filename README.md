A web site builder is a tool that simplifies the process of creating a website by providing the user with a ready-made template, which they can then customize. Tailbuild is one such example of this type of software.

Tailbuild provides developers with an easy way to create websites by using the Tailwind CSS, which was written to be lightweight and fast. It offers ready-made templates for web applications and differ
ent types of landing pages for SEO purposes.
